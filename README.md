I explored NYC’s 2015 street tree census to uncover insights about tree health, species distribution, and urban forestry challenges. The goal was to answer key questions like which boroughs have the healthiest trees, what common issues they face, and how this data can support better urban planning. I built five Tableau dashboards that break down borough-wise tree health and species strength, seasonal trends in data collection, environmental benefits of street trees, common problems like root damage and obstructed branches, and key contributors to the census effort. The project also revealed the practical challenges of working with large public datasets in Tableau — from performance issues to visual design — and served as a great exercise in transforming raw civic data into something meaningful for policy and environmental decision-making.
